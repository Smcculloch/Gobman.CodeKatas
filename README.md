#### Current status:

* Create page + create button on the index page. Adds people into the database. 
* Edit people's information. 
* Delete button.

#### Current idea's and problems:

### Create:
I can create a new person but it doesn't redirect me back to the index page, even though the edit page has the same exact return function. 

Update: Now goes to index.

### Edit: 
It works well, can change information and takes me back to the index page after information has been updated.

### Delete:
Have not been able to get it to work yet.

Update: Now works.

### Ideas: 
I have been making specific stored procedures to change the database. But I realise that making one big procedure might be better than multiple smaller ones.
